## What I believe
- An interface's design matters.
- Clear and concise variable names are beautiful.
- Code comments create clarity and enhance readability - strive to write code that is empathetic to the reader.
- Never answer a question with condescension; support other's growth.
- Sometimes, good code is challenging to read. [Shakespeare's plays are genius, but they're difficult to read.][typical-programmer]
